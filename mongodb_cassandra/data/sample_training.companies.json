The company has a presence in 49 countries, manufacturing facilities in 11 countries and serves customers in approximately 125 countries. Products The company manufactures and markets generic pharmaceuticals, value added generic pharmaceuticals, branded generics, active Pharmaceuticals (API) and intermediates. Its product basket of approximately 5,000 SKUs available in approximately 125 countries worldwide, encompasses a therapeutic mix covering a majority of the chronic and acute segments. Research &amp; Development The company offers value added formulations based on its Novel Drug Delivery System (NDDS) and New Chemical Entity (NCE) research outcomes. Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS): The company&#8217;s NDDS focus is mainly on the development of New Drug Applications (NDA) / Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) of oral controlled- release products for the regulated markets. Ranbaxy&#8217;s in-house NDDS programs are primarily focused on the oral segment. Inhalation (patented devices) and trans-dermal (patented adhesive polymers) programs are also being pursued through collaborations. In the oral NDDS space, Ranbaxy has developed four platform technologies namely Gastro Retentive, Modified Matrix, Multiparticulate and AeroGel. New Drug Discovery Research (NDDR): The companyâ€™s NDDR program focuses on select therapeutic segments of Infectious diseases, Metabolic diseases, Inflammatory/ Respiratory disease and Oncology. The company has 8-10 programs in the area of NDDR. For Arterolane (potential Anti-malarial candidate), the company has obtained approval from the Drug Controller General of India to initiate Phase III human clinical trials in India. The company is also profiling DPP-IV Inhibitors (Di-Peptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitors) for Type-2-diabetes, a selective Phosphodiesterase 4-b inhibitor for COPD and Asthma, and a novel antibiotic antibacterial for Community Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection. Under an alliance with an academic institution in India, various medicinal plants are being evaluated as potential sources for novel pharmaceutical agents. The company also has collaborative research projects with other academic institutions in India in the area of Respiratory and Infectious disease. Significant Events In June 2008, Ranbaxy entered into an alliance with Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd., to create a generic pharmaceutical powerhouse. On September 17, 2009, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. has entered into a strategic in-licensing agreement for the Indian market with Medy-Tox Inc. for its cosmetic product, Neuronox. Neuronox is a botulinum toxin type A complex (100 Units) pharmaceutical manufactured by Medy-Tox.

In addition to saving time and gas, the service can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n\n<p>Working directly with commercial garages, Primospot offers parking discounts and specials. In Q2 2009, the company announced a partnership with Park-It Guides to provide regional parking information in book form. Primospot also provides data services and general consulting to city and government agencies, transport services and other companies in need of parking solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Currently available for the New York City metro area, the company is quickly expanding to Boston and other major cities. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"40"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/8558/48558v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"67"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/8558/48558v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"301"},{"$numberInt":"81"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/8558/48558v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Primospot for iPhone","permalink":"primospot-for-iphone"},{"name":"Primospot for Android","permalink":"primospot-for-android"},{"name":"iParked for iPhone","permalink":"iparked-for-iphone"}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"New York","state_code":"NY","country_code":"USA","latitude":{"$numberDouble":"40.756054"},"longitude":{"$numberDouble":"-73.986951"}}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/finding-that-prime-parking-spot-with-primospot/","title":"NYTimes Bits Blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/04/two-apps-to-help-you-find-a-parking-spot/","title":"TUAW"},{"external_url":"http://ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=96328","title":"NY1"},{"external_url":"http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/06/02/2009-06-02_dont_leave_home_without_parking_spot_.html","title":"NY Daily News"},{"external_url":"http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1017243&page=2","title":"MSN Autos"}],"partners":[]}

To add a bottle to the E-Cellar, users simply search CorkSavvyâ€™s database, find the wine they are looking for, and click â€œchoose this bottle;â€ or they can quickly fill out an online form to add a bottle manually. Whatâ€™s more, wine lovers can upload photos of their bottles and write entries in a private Wine Journal to record the occasion or meal in which they enjoyed a bottle in their E-Cellar.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Savvy Reporter: The editors at CorkSavvy, led by Editorial Director Jill Sloane, compose original feature articles about wine (in the section titled â€œOur Savvy Reporterâ€), recommend a great bottle every week (â€œJillâ€™s Wine of the Weekâ€), conduct interviews with winemakers and sommeliers, offer wine-and-food-pairing suggestions, and respond to questions from readers (in the already popular â€œAsk CorkSavvyâ€ column). Every week, these stories and tips are also sent to mailing list subscribers as part of the CorkSavvy Newsletter.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Wine News: CorkSavvyâ€™s editorial team compiles the best wine-related articles and news items from around the world and posts a daily list of links to keep visitors in the know.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Restaurant Wine Lists: For wine enthusiasts looking to enjoy a bottle at a restaurant in their own city or while traveling, CorkSavvy has, for the first time on the web, made the wine lists of <em>#</em> restaurants around the world available in one place. In the â€œRestaurant Wine Listsâ€ section, users can search by name and location, find a restaurant, and then simply click â€œViewâ€ to be directed to the wine list on the restaurantâ€™s own web site (thus ensuring that the information is as up-to-date as possible).</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Global Winery Directory: With the Global Winery Directory, users can search the worldâ€™s wineries by name, country, region, and more. Each wineryâ€™s profile includes contact information, a link to the web site, a list of wines produced, and special features like â€œCertified Organic.â€ </p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Bottle Search: Getting more granular than the Global Winery Directory, the Bottle Search feature gives users access to detailed information on individual bottles of wine (for example, through the Winery Directory you might look up and learn about Cakebread Cellars, and in the Bottle Search you might search for Cakebreadâ€™s 2002 Merlot). In addition to finding the vintage, region, and grapes for each bottle, users can add bottles to their E-Cellar with the click of a button (specifically, the â€œAdd to Cellarâ€ button).</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Events Calendar: Since getting savvy about wine also requires oenophiles to step away from the keyboard and taste some juice, CorkSavvy offers a calendar of noteworthy wine-related events around the world.</p>\n\n<p>â€¢ Mobile Capabilities and Facebook: CorkSavvyâ€™s robust collection of features is available to wine lovers who are on the move, tooâ€”by downloading the mobile version of CorkSavvy, users can access all of the siteâ€™s content, including the E-Cellar application, from anywhere. In fact, users can even snap a photo of a bottle with an iPhone or other Smartphone, email it to CorkSavvy, and then it will be available for use in their E-Cellar. And recognizing the social function of wine, CorkSavvy has created a Facebook application that allows users to update and share the contents of their E-Cellars from right within Facebook. In the short time that the CorkSavvy Facebook application has been available, more than 5,000 Facebook users have downloaded it.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Editorial Director","person":{"first_name":"Jill","last_name":"Sloane","permalink":"jill-sloane"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"WineLog.net","permalink":"winelog-net"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Snooth Media","permalink":"snooth"}}],"providerships":[{"title":"application development, marketing","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"4elbows, LLC","permalink":"4elbows-llc"}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

Since then, ipadio has developed a number of services based on its core technology including their flagship ContactEngine for customer interactions, FieldTalk for workforce engagement, and HDMobileVideo for next generation video sharing.</p>\n\n<p>As well as millions of users around the globe, ipadio works with multinational corporations, UK Government departments and worldwide charities.  Ipadio technology is used in a broad range of industry sectors including: telecommunications, engineering, education, gaming, healthcare, household services, media, pharmaceutical, retail, sport and transport.</p>\n\n<p>Technology:\nipadio has combined the power of the Internet with the flexibility and reach of the telephony network.  The consequent cloud-hosted communications servers allow for the easy collection and distribution of any kind of digital content, be that audio, video, image or text.  ipadio makes its technology available to corporates via Software as a Service.<br/>\nipadio also makes its audio and video broadcasting services available to users around the globe via either smartphone / tablet apps, via standard telephony, or via satellite telephony.</p>\n\n<p>Software as a Service: </p>\n\n<p>ContactEngine: ipadio’s flagship service, ContactEngine is for large-scale daily customer communications.   ContactEngine uses a combination of the following ipadio services to achieve up to 100% customer contact;</p>\n\n<p>InteractiveTxt – like internet chat, but via text message.  It’s an easy light touch way to have a brief but detailed conversation with a customer.  The messages are automatically personalised, with each message dependent on the response to the previous one.  Customers can easily respond even when they’re at work or travelling. </p>\n\n<p>VoiceForms – a form you fill in, by voice.  It’s a bit like IVR, but less annoying, since the questions are pre-set to the individual, who are taken on their own personal route with no irritating menus to select from.  </p>\n\n<p>Apps – the latest addition to the customer service arsenal, ipadio consider it just another communications channel: alerts from your company pop up on customer’s tablets or smartphones just as they do from LinkedIn or Facebook.  </p>\n\n<p>Email – you’ll be familiar with that!</p>\n\n<p>ContactEngine is configurable to switch between the channels depending on the urgency of the contact requirement, the time of day, and any other business rules that need applying.  ContactEngine deals with wrong numbers and multiple phone numbers, duplicates and multi-day calling schedules, and a host of other complex daily communication challenges.  And of course there’s an online admin and email or text alerting for the admin staff and management.</p>\n\n<p>FieldTalk: One of our most popular services for Internal Communicators, it provides easy 2-way communication between multiple-layers of management &amp; staff without interrupting work schedules.</p>\n\n<p>EBrief: It’s like web conferencing, but without the high cost, hassle, or internet bandwidth requirements, so it’s ideal for mass engagement with customers, between staff and executives, or for monthly team updates.  A great way to engage thousands of people simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>HDMobileVideo: ipadio’s Apple and Android apps gather and distribute every sort of content (video, audio, phone, text, images) securely and on-brand.</p>\n\n<p>History:\nipadio’s core broadcasting technology was first used on November 1st 2008 via satellite phone from the mid-Atlantic, during the Transat Classique Lagasse race on a yacht called Infanta.  The name ipadio comes from Internet Protocol Radio – though the technology has come rather a long way since. </p>\n\n<p>2009: iphone app used globally for broadcasting audio, for example from the World Transplant Games on the Gold Coast of Australia.  Cross posting to social networks provided, along with embedded VoiceToText.  API developed. 2010:  Oxfam provide first broadcasts from Haitian Earthquake, and a number of charities such as The Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Great Ormond Street for Children and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award start using ipadio as part of the broadcasting and fundraising mix.  Several Sports bodies such as the English Golf Union, the British Horseracing Authority and England Athletics also start using ipadio.  Many educators such as Scotland’s College’s begin to use ipadio for language classes in particular.  Virgin Media become the first corporate client, followed by HomeServe.  ipadio move to offices in Farringdon.  Boris Johnson became one of the first celebrity users.</p>\n\n<p>2011: New clients include Grant Thornton, Ladbrokes, London Midland, an International Pharmaceutical that’s too private for us to name them but gosh they’re big, The Football Association, Guinness.  Video added to ipadio’s broadcasting capabilities.  Explorers such as Mark Wood, Jordan Romero, Felicity Ashton and Sara Outen join the ipadians as ipadio gets used from the South Pole, North Pole and top of Everest.</p>\n\n<p>2012: Further clients include NHS and Steria, JustGiving, LOCOG, Thames Water, Sony, O2 Health, United Utilities, Calibre, London 2012 and SSP UK.  Android app with video added to previous audio and phone broadcasting features. </p>\n\n<p>2013: This year ipadio will get our registration for ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security Management, as we see our flagship ContactEngine embraced by a number of existing and new blue-chip clients to allow them to interact more effectively with their millions of consumers.  New HD video sharing possibilities are being investigated, and we are expanding our team rapidly into new offices overlooking Smithfield Market.</p>\n\n<p>Funding ipadio was incubated by 3rd Sector digital communication specialists www.nemisys.uk.com, a company which ipadio’s directors also founded.

Zotero integrates tightly with online resources; it can sense when users are viewing a book, article, or other object on the web, andâ€”on many major research and library sitesâ€”find and automatically save the full reference information for the item in the correct fields. Since it lives in the web browser, it can effortlessly transmit information to, and receive information from, other web services and applications; since it runs on oneâ€™s personal computer, it can also communicate with software running there (such as Microsoft Word). And it can be used offline as well (e.g., on a plane, in an archive without WiFi).</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"40"}],"assets/images/resized/0008/7513/87513v2-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"66"}],"assets/images/resized/0008/7513/87513v2-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"300"},{"$numberInt":"80"}],"assets/images/resized/0008/7513/87513v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3504/","title":"Zotero Firefox Add-on"}],"partners":[]}

(L&C), a leading Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions provider for the healthcare industry. Over the past several months, the companies have been actively developing a radiology-specific, automated coding technology, which will make Zotec the only integrated system to provide RIS, billing and auto-coding functionality.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are proud to announce that weâ€™re currently auto-coding high volume procedure codes with associated diagnosis codes,â€ said T.

We are confident the accuracy will meet or exceed the normal levels in the industry.â€\r\n\r\nZotec Partners will offer the automated coding technology as a service option for its clients. For outsourced billing clients, this will create more consistent results, automated auditing capabilities and more efficient communication with physicians regarding questions on documentation.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are very excited to partner with Zotec Partners,â€ said Peter Huisman, CEO of Language and Computing. â€œTheir deep understanding of radiology and superior client roster really provides Language and Computing with an immediate ability to meet the needs of this market while improving the overall effectiveness.â€\r\n\r\nGiven Zotec Partnersâ€™ ability to provide a real-time denial percentage based on carrier, CPT and ICD9 code, integrating the NLP technology will provide the companyâ€™s clients with the most automated and efficient software in the industry. This will greatly reduce costs and improve coding accuracy for clients.\r\n\r\nLanguage and Computing is the only vendor that offers a patented, customizable, deployable NLP solution to the healthcare industry. L&Câ€™s solutions are being used to easily uncover and extract information in electronic medical records and healthcare documentation. Its solutions allow L&C customers and partners to leverage L&Câ€™s patented NLP technology to address a variety of healthcare and business needs, such as medical coding, decision support, quality of care, patient safety and terminology and knowledge management.\r\n\r\nZotec Partners is a solutions-based firm serving the hospital-based and outpatient imaging center specialty markets, offering a comprehensive suite of medical billing and practice management tools designed to make operations more efficient and productive in medical offices.

U.S. REITs have seen their equity market capitalization soar from $90 billion to roughly $200 billion in just the past 10 years. In the process, that growth has set the stage for the adoption of the REIT approach to securitized real estate investment across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Congress created REITs in the U.S. in 1960 as a way to make investment in large-scale, income-producing real estate accessible to all investors in the same way they typically invest otherwise â€“ through the purchase and sale of liquid securities. Prior to the creation of listed real estate equities, access to the investment returns of commercial real estate equity as a core asset was available only to institutions and wealthy individuals having the financial wherewithal to undertake direct real estate investment.</p>\n\n<p>In its early years, the industry was dominated by mortgage REITs, which provide debt financing for commercial or residential properties through their investments in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. The marketâ€™s interest in equity REITs, which today usually both own and manage commercial properties, initially was limited because the ownership and management of assets were required to remain separate. That restriction changed with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which permitted REITs to both own and manage their properties as vertically integrated companies and helped set the stage for a secular wave of equity REIT IPOs in the mid-1990s. Currently, 83 percent of the 134 publicly traded U.S. REITs are equity REITs that own and most often manage commercial real estate and derive most of their revenue and income from rents. In aggregate, these companies own properties across all major property sectors and all major geographic regions.</p>\n\n<p>In order for a company to qualify as a REIT in the U.S., it must comply with certain ground rules specified in the Internal Revenue Code. These include: investing at least 75 percent of total assets in real estate; deriving at least 75 percent of gross income as rents from real property or interest from mortgages on real property; and distributing annually at least 90 percent of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"143"},{"$numberInt":"33"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7854/97854v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"143"},{"$numberInt":"33"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7854/97854v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"143"},{"$numberInt":"33"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7854/97854v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"A.

When the program concluded in 1996 at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado, the final program close-out report concluded that, in spite of many impressive accomplishments â€” especially in the biological sciences â€” â€œthe high cost of algae production remains an obstacleâ€. The key barriers in 1996 were:\nLow cost of conventional fuel (diesel prices were hovering around $1.10 per gallon).\nNo monetary value for carbon mitigation capability of biodiesel.\nHigher than expected cost of the production system.\nLower than expected productivity of outdoor open pond system.\nA decade later, the world is different: Diesel is selling decisively at or above the $3.50 mark; the monetization of carbon is well underway in Europe with the US expected to follow soon; and a robust market for renewable biofuels had emerged.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2006, the algae-based biodiesel gauntlet was taken up by a proven team of engineers and entrepreneurs armed with a breakthrough design for a closed algae growth system that is cost competitive with open systems. With initial funding in hand, Solix Biofuels came on stage, ready to turn the promise of research into commercial reality.</p>\n\n<p>By August 2006 a first generation prototype had been built, tested, and analyzed, and a second generation prototype was launched. And the adventure is just beginning.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"73"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"224"},{"$numberInt":"110"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"224"},{"$numberInt":"110"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Schoonover","permalink":"richard-schoonover"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President Business Development","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Tuan","permalink":"james-tuan"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Bryan","last_name":"McCarty","permalink":"bryan-mccarty"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"L.

According to EnerNoc, the deployment of CarbonSMART across the state will be the largest carbon accounting software-as-service in the U.S. The program is expected to provide the Bay State with energy savings of 5 to 15 percent. Traditionally focused on demand response, EnerNoc began to diversify into carbon accounting and other fields approximately 18 months ago.\r\n\r\nThe management systems will allow building managers to track energy use in real time, alerting them to unexpected usage patterns and over time, highlight areas that need energy efficiency overhauls. \r\n\r\n\"Massachusetts spends over $200 million on energy every year,â€ Tim Healy, Chairman and CEO of EnerNoc, said in a statement. â€œLeveraging EnerNOC's application-driven approach to identify, implement, and track savings on electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, steam, water, and renewable energy resources is a cost-effective way to deliver substantial energy savings year after year, making an immediate impact on the Massachusetts economy.\"\r\n\r\nThe contract also leaves the door open for a phase II, which would allow EnerNoc to manage up to 50 million more square feet of state building space. \r\n\r\nThe deal enhances EnerNocâ€™s position in its own backyard. The Boston-based company is already working across New England with the State of Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the city of Boston. Expect to see it expand into Pennsylvania as well, which has made energy efficiency and demand response key components of its state's power platform.","source_description":"EnerNoc Wins $10M Contract in Massachusetts ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"9896"},"description":"EnerNOC Inc. saw revenue spike 58 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period a year ago","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2010"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"11"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"9"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2010/11/08/daily13-EnerNOC-Q3-revenue-jumps-on-customer-growth.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC Q3 revenue jumps on customer growth","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"10565"},"description":"reached an agreement to acquire a California-based company focused on energy efficiency and demand response programs for utilities.","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2010"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"12"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"6"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2010/12/06/daily2-EnerNOC-buys-Global-Energy-Partners.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC buys Global Energy Partners","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"11823"},"description":"has acquired an Idaho-based wireless technology firm specializing in energy management and demand response","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"1"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"26"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/01/24/daily33-EnerNOC-acquires-wireless-tech-firm-M2M.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC acquires wireless tech firm M2M","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"13164"},"description":"hired a new vice president of engineering","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"3"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"10"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/03/07/daily44-EnerNOC-names-Scandrett-as-VP-engineering.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC names Scandrett as VP, engineering","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"13296"},"description":"will open up new markets for EnerNOC","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"3"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"16"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/03/14/daily32-EnerNOC-to-get-boost-from-demand-response-pay-regs.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC to get boost from demand response pay regs","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"14934"},"description":"will provide demand response to a major electricity distribution network in England","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"5"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"18"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/05/16/daily33-EnerNOC-lands-third-UK-energy-management-customer.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC lands third UK energy management customer","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"15259"},"description":"demand response services provided on Tuesday for an East Coast electrical grid system represented its largest-ever dispatch","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"6"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"1"},"source_url":"http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/05/30/daily24-EnerNOC-provides-its-largest-demand-response-dispatch.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"EnerNOC provides its largest demand response dispatch","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"EnerNOC","permalink":"enernoc"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"15333"},"description":"Shares in EnerNOC Inc.

Established in late 2007, Trevena was created to translate groundbreaking research on GPCR signaling into a new generation of medicines.</p>\n\n<p>We have three programs in development: TRV027, currently in phase 2 clinical testing for the treatment of acute heart failure; TRV130, currently completing phase 1 testing for the intraveneous treatment of postoperative pain; and TRV734, currently in pre-clinical testing for oral treatment of acute and chronic pain. In addition, Trevena has built an early-stage portfolio of drug discovery programs currently in lead optimization.</p>\n\n<p>G protein coupled receptors are the targets for more than 30% of all currently marketed therapeutics. There is significant opportunity to improve upon currently marketed GPCR drugs because many have limited efficacy and undesirable adverse effects, which can prevent broader use. Furthermore, many GPCRs are linked to diseases but cannot be translated into medicines because of specific target-related adverse effects.

Initially it provides free, customisable, online bookshops for its charity, business, voluntary group, blogger, school and university clients, sourcing the platformâ€™s several million books from the largest UK wholesalers and publishers. Profits on all sales are shared fifty/fifty with clients.</p>\n\n<p>Eclector 3.0, whose most important component is a Build-Your-Own-Shop facility, was launched in early July 2010. This makes it quick, intuitive and easy for anyone to build their own shop, thus opening up the huge market for smaller organisations, bloggers and social networkers. Eclector 3.0 has also added millions of second-hand books to the catalogue, while enabling shop owners to sell and fulfil their own titles.</p>\n\n<p>As of July 15th, sixty clients have signed up, including small and large charities, the Ramblers, Future Publishing, Vetstream (an international resource for vets), several SMEs including sites for toy collectors, model plane enthusiasts and horse owners, a couple of schools, and the Institutes of Mechanical Engineering and Knowledge Transfer.  </p>\n\n<p>Initial client testing started to produce revenues in November 2009. The Company owns the IP in the platform it continues to develop. The business is cash-positive and virtual: its orders are purchased after customers have paid for them and after they have been drop shipped by the Companyâ€™s suppliers.\nEclector exploits the strength of niche affiliate marketing methods within the broader book market. The Internet book market is predicted to be worth Â£663m in 2010; Â£1.19 billion in 2014 (Verdict Research). Of the 28.5m people in the UK who bought an average of 12 books, 4.7m did so online. Addressable UK markets of potential clients in six different sectors have been identified, which at conservative estimates are worth Â£179m per annum to the business.</p>\n\n<p>The initial route to market uses a compelling sales proposition that ensures early penetration of the Companyâ€™s niche marketplaces. 1) Clients are supplied, free of charge, with an e-commerce bookshop, customised for their audience and filled with three million books. 2) Clients are then assisted to market this service to their supporters. 3) Clients are given 50% of the profits earned on every book sold through their shop (thatâ€™s Â£2 on an average Â£10 book) â€“ not limited by cookies and as much as five times more than Amazon affiliates earn.\nThe founder, William Pryor, has built a management team that have extensive experience of the book trade, building and managing large scale web platforms, marketing and managing rapid growth. They recognise that as the business grows, they will need to augment their skills and experience with some key additions to the team, primarily in e-marketing and larger scale internet platforms.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"25"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9975/49975v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"42"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9975/49975v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"76"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/9975/49975v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"bookshops","permalink":"bookstores"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"Pryor","permalink":"william-pryor"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"COO","person":{"first_name":"Genevieve","last_name":"Pascoe","permalink":"genevieve-pascoe"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Shelfari","permalink":"shelfari"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Amazon","permalink":"amazon"}},{"competitor":{"name":"The Book Depository","permalink":"the-book-depository"}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£160k","funding_rounds":[{"id":{"$numberInt":"6782"},"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.earlyequity.co.uk/earlyequity_news.html","source_description":"an innovative approach to online bookselling","raised_amount":{"$numberInt":"50000"},"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":{"$numberInt":"2008"},"funded_month":{"$numberInt":"8"},"funded_day":{"$numberInt":"10"},"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Early Equity","permalink":"early-equity"},"person":null}]},{"id":{"$numberInt":"6783"},"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":{"$numberInt":"110000"},"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":{"$numberInt":"2010"},"funded_month":{"$numberInt":"5"},"funded_day":null,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":null,"person":{"first_name":"friends","last_name":"& family","permalink":"friends-family-3"}}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"World Headquarters","address1":"Hampton Hall","address2":"Warminster Road","zip_code":"BA2 6SQ","city":"Bath","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"id":{"$numberInt":"3450"},"description":"Paul O'Callaghan, who invested Â£30k in October 2009, has just invested a further Â£16k.","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2010"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"1"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"18"},"source_url":"","source_text":null,"source_description":"","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Eclector","permalink":"eclector"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"120"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/7600/57600v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"200"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/7600/57600v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"360"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/7600/57600v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"115"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/3627/93627v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"192"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/3627/93627v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"346"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/3627/93627v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

As the worldâ€™s first commercial ultra-miniature laser-scanning technology, PicoP uses highly efficient laser light sources to display vivid widescreen images with high contrast and brightness up to and over 8 feet diagonally  in size.</p>\n\n<p>MicroVisionâ€™s products address the unmet need facing growing mobility marketsâ€“consumers want a far bigger viewing experience than they currently get from small mobile device displays. Considering the growth of YouTube, flip video cameras and Apple devices, consumers themselves are increasingly the content creators, and sharing those creations in the real-world has meant squinting and huddling around a small screen. The PicoP laser display engine is small and low power enough to be embedded directly into devices such as smartphones, media players, camcorders and tablets. MicroVision is collaborating with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the telecommunications, gaming and consumer electronics markets to create new experiences that free consumers from the small screen in addition to creating new opportunities for carriers, content producers and brand marketers.</p>\n\n<p>In vertical markets, such as automotive, aviation, medical and defense, there is strong demand for innovative display and imaging products that overcome todayâ€™s limitations. For example, the PicoP laser display engine can be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a head-up display (HUD), placing critical information directly on the windshield of an automobile or into see-through eyewear displays. MicroVision is working closely with various automotive suppliers including Pioneer, which is targeting commercial introduction of an in-vehicle HUD using PicoP technology for the consumer market in 2012. The company has also entered into contracts with commercial and government customers to develop high-definition, see-through eyewear displays.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"83"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"151"},{"$numberInt":"84"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"151"},{"$numberInt":"84"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0180/50180v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"SHOWWX","permalink":"showwx"},{"name":"SHOWWX+","permalink":"showwx-2"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Tokman","permalink":"alex-tokman"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP, General Counsel and Secretary","person":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"M.

Phase Forward&#8217;s technology and global services are designed to enable life sciences companies to automate and integrate the management of their entire clinical development process â€“ from study initiation and FDA submission through post-marketing studies. </p>\n\n<p>Until its acquisition by <a href=\"/company/oracle\" title=\"Oracle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oracle</a> in April 2010, Phase Forward was a publicly held company. Its corporate headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, international headquarters in Maidenhead, UK, and its regional offices in the U.S., Japan, France and Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Phase Forward was founded in 1997 by Paul Bleicher, M.D, Ph.D., who had experienced firsthand the complexities involved in developing and conducting paper-based trials â€“ in particular, capturing, managing, and growing volumes of data. Dr. Bleicherâ€™s vision was to develop technology that would enable organizations to make the shift from paper-based methods to Internet-enabled solutions. His pioneering efforts have contributed significantly to Phase Forwardâ€™s evolution from initial concept to its current industry-leading position.</p>\n\n<p>Spearheading the evolution of electronic data capture (EDC) with its industry-leading InFormâ„¢ solution, Phase Forward has transformed the way clinical data are collected, analyzed and managed. With the acquisition of Lincoln Technologiesâ€™ innovative safety management solutions, Phase Forward took steps to provide the end-to-end solutions customers need to track and monitor product efficacy and safety, while building their trials more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"13"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"23"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"260"},{"$numberInt":"24"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0981/50981v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Gus","last_name":"Lawlor","permalink":"gus-lawlor"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co Founder","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Dale","permalink":"richard-dale-3"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"President and Chief Executive Officer","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"K.Weiler","permalink":"robert-k-weiler"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Stamos","permalink":"nicholas-stamos"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CFO, CAO, Treasurer","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Menard","permalink":"christopher-menard"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President","person":{"first_name":"Will","last_name":"Porter","permalink":"will-porter"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Vice President, Finance","person":{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Menard","permalink":"christopher-menard"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"SVP Legal and Regulatory Services","person":{"first_name":"Ari","last_name":"Buchler","permalink":"ari-buchler"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Director","person":{"first_name":"Dr.","last_name":"James Cash","permalink":"dr-james-cash"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Operational Account Management & SaaS Services","person":{"first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Venable","permalink":"scott-venable"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Chief Technologist, IRT Products Group","person":{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Talapan","permalink":"adrian-talapan"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Investor","person":{"first_name":"Axel","last_name":"Bichara","permalink":"axel-bichara"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":{"$numberInt":"685000000"},"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/16/oracle-buys-healthcare-software-firm-phase-forward-for-685-million/#ixzz0lhEbXNzs","source_description":"Oracle Buys Healthcare Software Firm Phase Forward For $685 Million ","acquired_year":{"$numberInt":"2010"},"acquired_month":{"$numberInt":"4"},"acquired_day":{"$numberInt":"20"},"acquiring_company":{"name":"Oracle Corporation","permalink":"oracle"}},"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":{"$numberInt":"14000000"},"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://investor.phaseforward.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=177364&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1279275&highlight=","source_description":"Phase Forward Acquires Waban Software","acquired_year":{"$numberInt":"2009"},"acquired_month":{"$numberInt":"4"},"acquired_day":{"$numberInt":"22"},"company":{"name":"Waban Software","permalink":"waban-software"}},{"price_amount":{"$numberInt":"11000000"},"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash","source_url":"http://www.freshnews.com/news/187436/phase-forward-acquires-maaguzi-llc-innovative-provider-web-based-electronic-patient-repo","source_description":"Phase Forward Acquires Maaguzi LLC, Innovative Provider of Web-Based Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) and Late Phase Solutions","acquired_year":{"$numberInt":"2009"},"acquired_month":{"$numberInt":"7"},"acquired_day":{"$numberInt":"27"},"company":{"name":"Maaguzi","permalink":"maaguzi"}}],"offices":[{"description":"Phase Forward Inc.","address1":"77 Fourth Avenue","address2":"","zip_code":"02451","city":"Waltham","state_code":"MA","country_code":"USA","latitude":{"$numberDouble":"42.392966"},"longitude":{"$numberDouble":"-71.259334"}}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"101"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"169"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"305"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/0982/50982v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

We make the only 100% safe insecticide that is proven to work. We offer the only complete line of EPA exempt pesticides sold in the US.</p>\n\n<p>EcoSMART was the first company to apply modern science to essential plant oils — creating the first 100% safe pesticides. Our products are based on the natural defenses that plants and trees have used for their self protection against insects and pathogens for millenia – essential oils.</p>\n\n<p>University research has shown that these oils attack octopamine neuro-receptors. Octopamine is a key insect neurotransmitter that regulates insect movement, behavior and metabolism. The blockage of the receptor activity prevents the transmission of the octopamine signals, which delivers quick knock down, kill and repellency against a wide variety of household pests such as cockroaches, ants, dust mites, flies, wasps, spiders, crickets, and fleas. Our blends of natural plant oils are every bit as effective as synthetic chemicals, killing bugs fast without any toxins or harmful residues.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"30"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/1145/51145v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"214"},{"$numberInt":"44"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/1145/51145v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"214"},{"$numberInt":"44"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/1145/51145v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Vern","last_name":"M.

With more than 20 years of experience, the company is one of the pioneers in this field.</p>\n\n<p>As a leading German security specialist, Avira has sound experience in the development and support of its solutions. In addition to programs specifically for use on single workstations, Avira primarily offers professional solutions for cross-system protection of networks on various levels. These include products for workstations, file, mail and web servers. Gateway computers can be managed as workstation computers via a central management console for all operating systems. In addition to the management products of the individual solutions, security programs for PDAs, smartphones and embedded devices are also offered. Our clients include renowned national and international corporations, educational institutions and public clients. Avira AntiVir Personal, used by millions of private users, represents a significant contribution to security.</p>\n\n<p>In Tettnang, near the Lake Constance Avira is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs. The company has several locations in Germany and partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. Worldwide approximately 300 persons are employed. Dozens of researchers in various virus labs attend to local and global threats on the virus front around the clock. This work is acknowledged, for example, by several test awards with the VB 100% of the Virus Bulletin or by repeated TÃœV certification.</p>\n\n<p>As a technological leader in the Unix market, Avira develops leading-edge standards. Other Avira innovations include virus protection solutions for Symbian and the worldâ€™s first SAP-certified virus protection.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to intelligent technologies, Avira offers solution-oriented advice and individual support from our own experts under the motto â€œMore than Securityâ€. Protection of users with Avira AntiVir Personal represents a significant contribution to security and a further additional firewall for corporate networks.</p>\n\n<p>Awards and certifications of the Avira products and partnerships with corporations such as IBM, Sun, Novell, AVM or Clearswift underline the efficiency and core competency of the company. Security solutions from Avira are in demand worldwide and immediately available locally via trained, authorized partners.</p>\n\n<p>Distributed all over the world, many integration partners directly implement the Avira AntiVir scan engine â€œSavapiâ€ in OEM products. Savapi and the underlying scanning technology are characterized by cross-platform and processor-independent programming. This includes use with Windows and Linux as well as on Intel and non-Intel processors. Thanks to the use of resource-saving programming technologies, Avira products have low RAM requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Avira constantly adapts to the current security requirements of the users. AntiVir is therefore one of the worlds first ever products with dialer detection. This dialer detection was very quickly followed by the detection and removal of adware and spyware. Current developments in this field include the detection of already active root kits. The introduction of a firewall and behavior blockers is a matter of course. In-house development also allows the development of various new special scanning technologies, for example for PDAs, handhelds and embedded devices.</p>\n\n<p>Aviraâ€™s national and international customers include renowned corporations listed on the stock exchange but also educational institutions and public authorities. In addition to protection of the virtual environment, Avira also provides for more protection and security in the real world by supporting the Auerbach Foundation. Established by the founder of the company, the Auerbach Foundation promotes charitable and social projects as well as the arts, culture and science.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"51"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1732/181732v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"187"},{"$numberInt":"64"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1732/181732v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"187"},{"$numberInt":"64"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1732/181732v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Avira AntiVirus","permalink":"avira-antivirus"},{"name":"SocialShield","permalink":"socialshield"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"General Manager, North America","person":{"first_name":"Lance","last_name":"Jacobs","permalink":"lance-jacobs"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Greg","last_name":"Dean","permalink":"greg-dean"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Content Marketing Specialist","person":{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Antiu","permalink":"victor-antiu"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Symantec","permalink":"symantec"}},{"competitor":{"name":"McAfee","permalink":"mcafee"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Trend Micro","permalink":"trend-micro"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Sophos","permalink":"sophos"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Kaspersky","permalink":"kaspersky"}},{"competitor":{"name":"AVG Technologies","permalink":"avg"}},{"competitor":{"name":"AVAST Software","permalink":"avast"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Panda Security","permalink":"panda-security"}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":null,"source_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/29/idUS104728+29-Mar-2012+BW20120329","source_description":"Avira Acquires SocialShield","acquired_year":{"$numberInt":"2012"},"acquired_month":{"$numberInt":"3"},"acquired_day":{"$numberInt":"29"},"company":{"name":"SocialShield","permalink":"socialshield"}}],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Kaplaneiweg 1","address2":"","zip_code":"88069","city":"Tettnang","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"id":{"$numberInt":"44432"},"description":"Avira Antivirus Premium ranked by TopTenReviews","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2013"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"12"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"16"},"source_url":"http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/avira-antivir-review.html","source_text":null,"source_description":"Avira Antivirus Premium","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Avira","permalink":"avira"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"114"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1733/181733v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"190"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1733/181733v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"343"}],"assets/images/resized/0018/1733/181733v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

Its initial product is Semanti, a web service that enhances and personalizes the search engine experience by delivering more relevant and meaningful search results, based on individuals&#8217; previous searches, as well as their trusted friends and the Semanti community&#8217;s results. Semanti is currently available as a Firefox add-on and works seamlessly with the Google, Yahoo! and Bing search engines. The company is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. For more information, visit www.semanti.com.</p>\n\n<p>Product:\nSemanti is a search enhancement tool that provides users with smart social search&#8211;the ability to help Internet users find, retrieve and share more relevant information faster and easier than ever before. Semanti employs a unique semantic-based search methodology that integrates with Facebook Connect to allow users to search at a social level, and offers new tools for personalized searches. A free browser plug-in, Semanti works with all industry-leading search engines (including Microsoft Bing), so users do not have to change their existing search behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>Social Search:\nA user simply downloads the free Semanti plug-in and invites their Facebook Friends to do so as well. Using their preferred search engines like Google, Microsoft Bing and Yahoo!, friends click on links they find relevant to their inquiries. Then when an individual conducts a search based on a specific topic, the friends&#8217; results and recommendations appear at the top of their search engine results marked as being endorsed by their Facebook friends. For example, a user searching for a new restaurant will benefit from seeing which restaurants their Facebook friends have researched and saved. A restaurant recommended by a friend has far more relevance to an individual than one that shows up in a general web search. </p>\n\n<p>Personal Search:\nSemanti tools like MyWeb create a personal search engine experience. When users find a page they like, they simply click on a button to save it so it is easy to find again later. Unlike bookmarks or favorites, MyWeb stores the entire page&#8217;s text along with the user&#8217;s search terms. Later, when the user is searching for the page again, they can find it using their preferred search engine-Semanti will search the text on the user&#8217;s saved pages as well as the search terms originally used to find those pages and then display matching results above the usual search engine results. Because the pages are saved by Semanti, the user can access them from any computer without having to worry about whether or not their bookmarks or favorites are on located on a particular computer.</p>\n\n<p>Better Search:\nSemanti improves the overall search experience through its innovative and unique semantic-based search methodology. Semanti Suggest(TM) helps users specify the exact meaning of their search terms via a drop-down menu. As a result, users receive results that match what they mean rather than what they say, eliminating ambiguity. Semanti also knows there are many different ways that people can say the same thing. Semanti understands that &#8216;Store&#8217;, &#8216;Shop&#8217; and &#8216;Retailer&#8217; generally mean the same thing so regardless of which search term the user chooses, Semanti will ensure that the user receives the best results. Once individuals find a result they like, that person simply clicks on a button to save the page, marking it as relevant. Each approved web page becomes available to the Semanti community, enriching everyone&#8217;s search experience. This approach uses the &#8216;wisdom of the crowds&#8217; to sort out the relevant pages from the inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers can download and install the free browser plug-in at www.semanti.com.

The foundersâ€™ detailed knowledge and understanding of carrier billing was formed from many years spent selling and integrating carrier services.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, this knowledge base became Total Telecom Consulting. In all their years working on the carrier sales side of the industry, the founders identified a clear need in the marketplace for consulting designed to help fiscal managers within organizations streamline and understand the telecom &amp; Tech line items of their P&amp;L.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends show that clients need to reduce budgets in order to justify needed projects or purchases. Discovering that most CFO&#8217;s and Controllers responsible for managing organizational expense rarely possess the amount of time or skill set necessary to track down all the anomalies characteristic of telecom billing.\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s business climate all businesses have some sort of pain when it comes to telecom services, and Total Telecom Consulting business model truly addresses these pains. After many years of representing specific products to prospects it was realized that this approach was totally incorrect. How can you expect to  truly help customers when you are carrying commitments to specific vendors with specific products? Every customer has a very unique situation and your business model must adapt and change to address each clients unique needs and goals on a continuous basis. </p>\n\n<p>Total Telecom Consulting is now positioned as a non exclusive partner to every major carrier and vendor in the marketplace both nationally and internationally, and our firm carries no revenue commitments with these carriers or vendors as many telecom agencies do. This provides a totally unbiased pool of resources to benefit customers with customized solutions and services. I hope that provides you with a little insight as to how Total Telecom Consulting differs from the typical telecom agency. Total Telecom Consulting handles all bid processes, procurement, and if needed project and services management on the clients behalf. We eliminate the need to meet with multiple sales people, without taking away the confidence that you&#8217;ve looked at all the options. Our services provide an expert single point of contact for all telecom and technology related processes and projects. </p>\n\n<p>There are no scenarios where we try to make a product work (square peg round hole) to fit a customers need. Total Telecom Consulting does however target the customers business processes, needs, and from there the correct product sets are discovered that will provide and address needs thus improving business processes. Total Telecom also handles many private bid processes for contractors and corporate relocation specialists who have telecom cabling/fiber and or infrastructure built into specific projects, this provides them with expert insight and a single point of contact for RFP&#8217;s, project management, and forward management. </p>\n\n<p>Other focuses of Total Telecom Consulting business model are business continuity, disaster / telecom recovery, and Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢. These services are truly setting a standard of excellence leaving clients much less vulnerable to outages and lost revenues due to outages or data loss. The Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ portion shelters the customer from incorrect billings and provides prompt recovery of incorrect billings. Most organizations that are driven to being progressive and value Unbiased insight into these pains find tremendous value, especially in instances where they cannot afford or are not getting results needed with an internal technology staff member*. In regard to Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ we have provided a few snippets from our website that  provides insight into how the industry has progressed and why there is such an overwhelming demand for these services. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"116"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2309/52309v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"193"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2309/52309v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"349"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2309/52309v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Total Telecom Expense Managment","permalink":"total-telecom-expense-managment"},{"name":"Telecom Recovery","permalink":"telecom-recovery"},{"name":"Unbiased telecom & technology consulting","permalink":"unbiased-telecom-technology-consulting"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Stevens","permalink":"robert-stevens"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Home Office1","address1":"2218 Bosutead st","address2":"","zip_code":"15216","city":"Pittsburgh","state_code":"PA","country_code":"USA","latitude":{"$numberDouble":"40.40509"},"longitude":{"$numberDouble":"-80.032726"}}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"116"},{"$numberInt":"150"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2307/52307v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"194"},{"$numberInt":"250"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2307/52307v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"349"},{"$numberInt":"450"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2307/52307v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"116"},{"$numberInt":"150"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2308/52308v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"194"},{"$numberInt":"250"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2308/52308v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"349"},{"$numberInt":"450"}],"assets/images/resized/0005/2308/52308v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://totaltelecomconsulting.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/interview-with-robert-stevens-founder-and-ceo-of-pittsburgh-based-total-telecom-consulting/","title":"Interview with Robert Stevens Founder and CEO of Pittsburgh Based Total Telecom Consulting"},{"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertlstevens","title":"President & CEO Robert STevens LinkedIN profile"}],"partners":[]}

It&#8217;s not a job site or a social network: our proprietary technology anonymously brings users those potential partners, and resources most compatible with their needs and ideas. From a one-time project to an ongoing business, users are quickly and anonymously matched with who (and what) they need to make it happen. </p>\n\n<p>MergeSkills takes a data driven approach to help business professionals find targeted and relevant matches the first time â€“ every time! MergeSkills members begin by anonymously completing a business relationship questionnaire that focuses on core professional and compatibility traits such as passion, risk-averseness, skills, industries, willingness to invest, etc. MergeSkills members then anonymously complete a similar questionnaire for each type of project they are looking to pursue or professional they are looking to connect with. The MergeSkills bi-directional matching algorithms take over, providing MergeSkills members with highly targeted and relevant results.  </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"40"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7974/97974v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"68"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7974/97974v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"68"}],"assets/images/resized/0009/7974/97974v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Polis","permalink":"john-polis"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[{"id":{"$numberInt":"16582"},"description":"MergeSkills.com Business Matchmaking platform and website goes Beta\r\n\r\nBusiness Matchmaking technology and website is for anyone who has a business idea and is looking for partners, who is interested in working at a hot new startup, or who is looking to b","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"7"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"20"},"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/7/prweb8650421.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"MergeSkills.com Business Matchmaking platform and website goes Beta","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"MergeSkills","permalink":"mergeskills"}},{"id":{"$numberInt":"16583"},"description":"MergeSkills.com Business Matchmaking platform and website goes Beta","stoned_year":{"$numberInt":"2011"},"stoned_month":{"$numberInt":"7"},"stoned_day":{"$numberInt":"20"},"source_url":"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/7/prweb8650421.htm","source_text":null,"source_description":"MergeSkills.com Business Matchmaking platform and website goes Beta","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"MergeSkills","permalink":"mergeskills"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}
